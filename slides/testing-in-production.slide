* The project

- Integrate something, anything into a location based game

- Build and Integration over a three day weekend, actually only 1 day

* Our office

* Making It

- Maker movement not to be confused with Burning Man

- It is also not the radio shack hobbiest electronics transported to today

- Maker movement is becoming a social, team oriented activity

- Consumers becoming Producers

* Community

How does an under represented teen create patentable technology

[[circuito.io][circuito.io]]      Quick demo

Arduino IDE      Quick Demo

* Extensible Gaming

Ingress started with 2 tools, phone based and desktop based

Player created tools have proliferated, some very rich

Social games motivate innovation

* Scanner Interface

* Ingress

1 Billion players use Niantic location based gaming

Deployed using Google Cloud Compute

Staff of 120

Driven by advertising and data collection

* The intersection

Magnus 13 - Maker project with 13 teams

Teams typically had between 5-10 active members

Teams had between 10 and 30 others and we were allocated random members at the weekend

Integration between projects and the in-game state

Physical objects react to being attacked, captured, enhanced etc

Teams given gateway devices containing Arduino YUNs

Integration using JSON and TCP/IP

* Our Build

A mixture of SBC and Micro-controllers

* Integration

* The make results

All teams experienced failures in feeds from Niantic and shifting specifications onsite at the event

Teams with responsibilities not shared across multiple individuals generally failed

Two teams disappeared from the event 12 hours after arriving as a result of internal strife

Few (1) team(s) had integration to Niantic servers on the saturday evening

* Lessons

Priorities always dictate results, no team was able to complete more than one major activity ontime

Testing events across entire team, leads to trust building enabling people to backoff when others needed to get work done

Things worked when people by demonstrating competence took responsibility, competance is critical to creating trust QUICKLY

Sh*t breaks, ground faults, protocols diverging from spec

* Some futures for location based gaming

Games that are anchored at, and distributed from physical locations such as powerpoles

Games that evolve and have short lifespans
